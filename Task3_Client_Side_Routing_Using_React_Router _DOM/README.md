# React Routing Using React-Router-Dom

## Overview

**Task 3** of my **CODEXINTERN Front-End Web Development Internship** is a React application that demonstrates client-side routing using **React-Router-Dom**. The application consists of multiple components, including a fixed header and footer, while other components such as Home, Blog, and Feature change dynamically based on the route.

## Features

- **Client-Side Routing:** Efficient navigation between components without reloading the page.
- **Fixed Header & Footer:** The header and footer remain constant across all pages.
- **Dynamic Content:** Components like Home, Blog, and Feature update dynamically based on the current route.
- **Reusable Components:** Showcases modular and reusable React components.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Framework:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Routing Library:** React-Router-Dom
